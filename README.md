## Project

### Stack

I've chosen Vue JS because i'm more efficient with this framework. I use SCSS that i find more pratical than CSS. And of course HTML.

### Duration

To be honest, i begin this morning to 9, and i finish this afternoon arround 5 PM. So i take more than 3/4 hours recommended.

## Steps

### First step

I follow the differents point on the mail, i didn't really encounter issues on setup with Algolia, i choose the dataset of Airports. Because i love travel and i had lots idea to implement on app. But if we had to redo it i chosen a different data.

### First step

I setup my Vue project, i download dependencies that i needed.

### Third step

Read the doc of Algolia, and tried to grab most of it.

### Fourth step

Developpement.

## Steps

Problems encountered: There is not enough data on airport to implement as I wanted, that's why if I had to do it again, i'll choose an others datas.

So i needed to make call api, that's what i wanted to do for pictures, so i install axios, i call my api pixabay with city in params but it never worked i lost lot of time. I asked on stackOverFlow but no answer. My porblem is with Axios i can't return a link jpg to bind on the src of picture. So i decided to create a new component Card to store each link in data but i did not know how to do because of ais-hits is not an array or something else i can iterate over.
