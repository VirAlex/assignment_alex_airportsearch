# **Assignment of Algolia-Alexandre Viretti**
## **Project**
### **Stack**
I've chosen Vue JS because I'm more efficient with this framework. I use SCSS that I find more practical than CSS. And of course HTML.
### **Duration**
To be honest, I began this assignment at 9 this morning , and I finished this afternoon around 5 PM. So it took me more than 3/4 hours recommended.
## **Steps**
### **First step**
I followed the different points on the mail, I didn't really encounter issues on setup Algolia, I choose the dataset of the Airports, because I love to travel and I had lots idea to implement on this app. But if we had to redo it I would choose a different data.
### **First step**
I've setup my Vue project, I downloaded dependencies that I needed.
### **Third step**
Read the doc of Algolia, and tried to grab most of it.
### **Fourth step**
Developpement.
## **Design**
I coded flat design with some grid and flex box. I tried to stay sober, to get a better interaction with users. Easy to understand, easy to interact.
## **Testimony**
Problems encountered: There is not enough data on airport to implement it as I wanted, that's why if I had to do it again, I would choose an others set of datas.
I wanted to make an API call because I wanted to add pictures from Pixabay, so I installed Axios library, I called my api Pixabay with city in params but it never worked and I lost a  lot of time. I asked on stackOverFlow but no answer. 
My problem is with Axios I can't return a  jpg link to bind on the src of img tag. So I decided to create a new component Card to store each link in data but I did not know how to do it because ais-hits is not an array or something else I could iterate over.
Other, i found really interesting to interract with Algolia.
I hope this will meet your expectations.
